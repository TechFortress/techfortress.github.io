We currently host two game servers:

## Minecraft

The Tech Fortress Minecraft server aims to provide the closest you can get to a vanilla survival Minecraft experience, while providing self-service protection against griefers. Join the near-vanilla experience at IP: tf.robomwm.com

The current map has existed since 2013, with no plans to reset.

Tech Fortress differs from other vanilla servers in that it does not require a whitelist nor an omnipresent staff to maintain order. There are no teleportation commands, such as /home or /tp. All that exists gameplay-wise is free 24/7 property protection, so you can rest assured that your "Minecraft stuff" is safe while you attend to your real-world stuff.

### IP: `tf.robomwm.com`

## Team Fortress 2

A Mann vs. Machine server with unlimited money. Sometimes others are added. More info available at the [Steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TechFortress)
