1. Please use English

    > Dr. John Ogbu, Chancellor’s Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley - presenter at the National Catholic Educational Association 1998 - has researched Cultural Diversity and has made excellent observations. Dr. Ogbu is originally from Africa and has done numerous studies and shared his research concerning educational excellence. Also, Dr. Ogbu mentioned it is rude to speak a foreign language around those who do not speak in that language, especially if you can speak a common language. He stated, “No culture or language is better than another.” They are different, but not superior.

### Minecraft-specific

1. You may not use client modifications that exploit or provide any mechanical advantage over the vanilla client
    - This also includes, but is not limited to, see-through texture packs, modifications that allow you to move, jump or fly in a way not intended by the default game mechanics, block radars and any game glitch or exploit that gives you an unfair advantage of any kind over other players.
    - Mods that provide _only_ Java/rendering performance optimizations (e.g. increases FPS) are permitted.
    - The following mods are approved for all players:
      - Optifine
1. Report all working exploits and bugs you discover or know about
    - Reporting exploits helps ensure your stuff is protected.
    - By default, using exploits is not permitted.
      - Some exploits may be allowed; information on exceptions will be provided in your report.
    - Use /report to make a report in-game, or /ticket to manage your reports.
1. You must not significantly impact gameplay performance
    - Deliberately attempting to excessively stress a server in any form is not permitted.
1. Respect other's property
    1. Maliciously and knowningly modifying another active player's property (regardless of whether it is claimed) is not permitted. If the property is unclaimed or belongs to an inactive player (i.e. someone who has not logged in for over a year), any modifications must be minimal and non-malicious.
    1. Agreeing to share ownership of a claim (or territory) with another player implies that you both agree to allow each other to access the claim.
        - Sharing ownership occurs when both players have structures they own within the same claim.
        - If this implicit agreement is broken (e.g. one player untrusts the other, preventing them from entering the previously shared claim), the players involved should attempt to resolve the issue first. If this fails, you may file a /report briefly describing the situation.
1. Do not attempt to restrict access to publicly-accessible areas
    1. For all nether portals built inside a claim, please provide a path from the portal for players to get outside of the claim.
    1. The End exit portal and pillars are publicly-accessible areas which must not be restricted
