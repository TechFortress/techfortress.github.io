    > Dr. John Ogbu, Chancellor’s Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley - presenter at the National Catholic Educational Association 1998 - has researched Cultural Diversity and has made excellent observations. Dr. Ogbu is originally from Africa and has done numerous studies and shared his research concerning educational excellence. Also, Dr. Ogbu mentioned it is rude to speak a foreign language around those who do not speak in that language, especially if you can speak a common language. He stated, “No culture or language is better than another.” They are different, but not superior.
